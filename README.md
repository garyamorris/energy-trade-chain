energy-trade-chain is a Python-based blockchain project that simulates energy trading contracts. It features automated transactions, escrow management, and penalty enforcement, showcasing how blockchain can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Python

To get started with energy-trade-chain, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

- **Windows**: Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

- **macOS**: macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed. However, it is recommended to install the latest version. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check the version installed by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you need to install or update Python, use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3` for Ubuntu).

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the energy-trade-chain project directory. Use the following command:

\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/energy-trade-chain/
\`\`\`

Replace `/path/to/energy-trade-chain/` with the actual path where you have cloned or downloaded the energy-trade-chain project.

### 3. Run the Application

To start the energy-trade-chain simulation, execute the following command:

\`\`\`bash
python Main.py
\`\`\`

This command will initiate the energy-trade-chain simulation, allowing you to explore the various features of the project.
